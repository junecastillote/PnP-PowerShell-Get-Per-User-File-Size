## üìñ Overview

The **Get-SPOLibraryFileSize.ps1** script retrieves file size information from SharePoint Online document libraries.
It can generate a detailed report of all files or summarize storage usage per author.

This script excludes system libraries (`Style Library`, `Site Assets`, and `Form Templates`) to focus only on user-managed document libraries.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Lists all files across document libraries in a SharePoint Online site.
- Shows detailed metadata: **Site, Author, Email, Library, Folder, File Name, Size (MB)**.
- Optionally summarizes file sizes **by author**, including file count and total MB usage.
- Supports both **user-authored** and **app-authored** files.
- Automatically rounds file sizes to 2 decimal places.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- **PowerShell 7.x** (cross-platform).
- **[PnP.PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/)** module.

> NOTE: It is recommended to use app-only access with PnP PowerShell if targeting bulk SharePoint Online sites to avoid lack of permission issues. Refer to [Setting up access to your own Entra ID App for App Only Access](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/registerapplication.html#setting-up-access-to-your-own-entra-id-app-for-app-only-access).
